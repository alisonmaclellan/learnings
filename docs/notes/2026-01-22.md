I used StartRight to create 2 new proxima repos for the team. I found a number of issues creating a repo
- MsEng Production error - reported to Peter, it couldn't find the templates in the mseng org
- MsAzure - Did not create any of the inventory resources. It also did not create the agent.md or copilot-instructions.md ( I think we should)
- MsData - Created the inventory resources, but we still should create agent.md and copilot-instrctions.md
