- **Insight**: I need to try everything that pops into my head in Copilot, just to see what it does!
- **Links**: 
- **Follow-ups**: 
 
While creating the agents.md and copilot-instructions.md, I started with the existing files from Coral. After a few rounds of cleanup, I realized, I should just ask Copilot if it can generate these files for me. It used the original files I copied from Coral, and then it built out much better files. 

I then buried the team in PRs as I kept making changes. After asking the team if I can have Copilot do a review locally, I just went ahead and tried. And sure enough, it does!
