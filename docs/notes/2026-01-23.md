I spent the day trying to rebuild my phone and laptop. As I ran into issues, I used M365 Copilot to help me find answers. Sadly, I never got my phone to work, but 
I received a number of different things to try.

I have been building queries for the bankruptcy initiative. Since I already knew how to do this, I just built out the queries. Next week I'm going to have CoPilot
help me find the same data
