This is a lightweight wiki powered by **MkDocs** and **GitHub Pages**.

Use it to publish short, phone-friendly learning notes. Each note is a Markdown file under `docs/notes/`.

## Add a new note (from phone)
1. Open this repo in the GitHub mobile app (or browser).
2. Create a new file under `docs/notes/` named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
3. Paste your text (you can copy content from Loop as Markdown), commit to `main`.
4. Pages will auto-update in ~1–2 minutes.
